Creating an application like the one you described involves several components and technologies. Here's a high-level overview of the steps and the tools and programming languages you might use:

1. **Web Server**: You'll need a web server running on your PC to host the web application. You can use popular web server software like Apache, Nginx, or even Python's built-in `http.server` module for simple applications.

2. **Web Application**: Your web application will consist of an interface with programmable buttons that trigger actions on your PC. For the front-end (user interface), you'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript will handle button clicks and send requests to the server.

3. **Server-Side Logic**: You may need server-side logic to handle incoming requests from the web interface and perform actions on your PC. You can use server-side scripting languages like Python (using frameworks like Flask or Django), Node.js, Ruby (using Ruby on Rails), or any language you are comfortable with.

4. **Local Communication**: To interact with your PC, you may need to use system-level commands or APIs. The choice of programming language for this depends on the specific actions you want to trigger. For example:
   - For general system-level automation, Python is often a good choice because of its extensive standard library.
   - For Windows-specific tasks, you might use C# or PowerShell.
   - For Mac-specific tasks, you might use AppleScript or Swift.

5. **Cross-Device Compatibility**: To make your application work on multiple devices, you should ensure that the web interface is responsive and works well on various screen sizes. You can use responsive design principles and frameworks like Bootstrap or CSS Grid.

6. **Networking**: Ensure that your local web server is accessible from other devices on your network. You may need to configure your firewall and network settings to allow incoming connections.

7. **Security**: Be mindful of security considerations, especially if you plan to access your PC remotely. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect your system.

8. **Testing and Debugging**: Test your application thoroughly on different devices and browsers to ensure it works as expected. Debugging tools like browser developer consoles and server logs will be valuable.

9. **Deployment**: Once your application is ready, you can deploy it on your local web server. Make sure it runs as a service or a background process, so it's always available.

10. **Documentation**: Document the setup and usage of your application for future reference.

The specific tools and languages you choose will depend on your familiarity and the requirements of your application. Additionally, you might consider using frameworks and libraries to streamline development. For example, you can use JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js for the front-end and Flask or Express.js for the server-side logic.

Overall, the procedure involves designing the web interface, implementing the server-side logic, ensuring communication with your PC, testing thoroughly, and deploying the application on your local web server.
